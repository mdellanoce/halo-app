/**
 * Settings — Reset demo data modal (SET-06 + UI-03 + D-17).
 *
 * Destructive-action confirmation modal. Opening is owned by PreferencesTab
 * (via the Danger zone button); this component just renders the modal and
 * the reset handler.
 *
 * Reset sequence (D-17 lock):
 *
 *   1. Enumerate `localStorage` for keys starting with the `halo:v` prefix
 *      and remove each. This covers `halo:v1:visitors`, `halo:v1:workspaces`,
 *      `halo:v1:session`, `halo:v1:tasks:<workspaceId>`, `halo:v1:meta`, and
 *      any forward-compatible v-bumped keys.
 *
 *   2. Wipe the sessionStorage signup draft via `K.signupDraft()`. Wrapped
 *      in try/catch to absorb private-browsing sessionStorage throws
 *      (T-04-04-05 mitigation).
 *
 *   3. Do NOT remove Mantine's color-scheme localStorage key — theme
 *      preference survives reset per D-17 + D-26. Mantine owns that key;
 *      it is OUTSIDE the halo:v* envelope by design.
 *
 *   4. Hard reload to '/'. Window navigation (not React Router) is the
 *      deliberate choice — re-runs the boot sequence (Mantine init, codec
 *      hydration, auth store module-init) with clean state.
 *
 * No `notifications.show()` after reset — the hard reload destroys the JS
 * context before any toast could render (UI-SPEC §"Toast Notifications"
 * line 848 lock).
 *
 * FND-04 codec exception: bulk wipe by prefix requires enumerating
 * `localStorage.key(i)`, which `src/storage/codec.ts` does not expose
 * (codec's `removeKey()` is single-key only). Direct localStorage access
 * here is the SOLE caller-site exception in the codebase; documented
 * inline below.
 *
 * Note on the two-pass collect-then-remove loop: collecting keys into an
 * array before removal is the CORRECT pattern for iterating over localStorage
 * while removing keys. Modifying localStorage during a `localStorage.key(i)`
 * forward iteration shifts indices and silently skips keys. The two-pass
 * approach is deliberately correct — do NOT "fix" it to a single-pass loop.
 *
 * UAT 2b contract clarification — halo:v1:meta after reset:
 *
 * At reset-confirm time, the two-pass scan-then-remove deletes EVERY key
 * whose name starts with `halo:v`, including `halo:v1:meta`. The
 * user-observable state at this exact moment (before the hard reload) is:
 * zero `halo:v1:*` keys remain in localStorage. The wipe contract is honored.
 *
 * Immediately after, `window.location.href = '/'` triggers a hard reload.
 * The reload re-runs the app boot sequence: `src/main.tsx` calls
 * `runMigrations()` (from `src/storage/migrations.ts`) BEFORE React mounts.
 * `runMigrations()` calls `peekRaw(K.meta())` — finds `null` — and writes
 * `DEFAULT_META = { schemaVersion: 1, seededAt: null, appVersion: '0.1.0' }`
 * as the storage envelope's boot record. This is by design: the codec and
 * migration runner require meta to exist before any other key is read or
 * written.
 *
 * The post-reload `halo:v1:meta` contains NO user data (no tasks, no
 * visitors, no workspaces, no session). It is purely the schema-version
 * envelope: `{ schemaVersion: 1, seededAt: null, appVersion: '0.1.0' }`.
 * The `seededAt: null` value means the app is in a fresh-boot state and
 * will re-run the fake-data seed on first authenticated workspace load.
 *
 * Future UAT runners who observe `halo:v1:meta` in localStorage after reset
 * should inspect its VALUE. If it is `{ schemaVersion: 1, seededAt: null,
 * appVersion: '0.1.0' }` with no embedded tasks/visitors/workspaces, the
 * reset contract is honored. Only a meta value with non-null `seededAt` OR
 * with embedded user data would indicate a true wipe failure.
